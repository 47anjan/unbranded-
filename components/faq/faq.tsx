    question: "Why is professional landing page design crucial for conversion?",
    answer:
      "In today's competitive digital landscape, your landing page serves as your 24/7 sales team. Our research-backed designs optimize user flow and psychological triggers to convert visitors into customers. We combine conversion-focused strategies with exceptional UX to ensure your page not only looks stunning but drives measurable results.",

    question: "Why choose your agency over DIY website builders?",
    answer:
      "While DIY tools offer temporary convenience, they often result in generic designs with poor performance and accessibility issues. Our custom solutions are built on industry best practices with mobile-first responsiveness, WCAG compliance, and strategic conversion paths. We handle technical optimization while you maintain full ownership of every pixel we create.",

    id: "item-3",
    question: "What makes your design process different?",
    answer:
      "Our 360Â° approach combines user psychology with technical excellence. Every project starts with competitor analysis and user journey mapping. We then prototype multiple variants for A/B testing potential, ensuring your final design isn't just beautiful - it's scientifically optimized for your target audience's behavior patterns.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-4",
    question: "Do we own the rights to the designs?",

      "Absolutely. All final assets including source files (Figma/XD), development handoff specs, and copyrights are transferred to you upon project completion. We even include a style guide documentation to ensure brand consistency across future implementations.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-5",
    question: "How do you ensure accessibility compliance?",
    answer:
      "Accessibility is baked into our process from day one. All designs meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation flows, and screen reader optimization. We conduct real user testing with assistive technologies to guarantee inclusive experiences.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-6",
    question: "What support do you provide post-launch?",
    answer:
      "Our partnership continues beyond delivery. We offer 30 days of complimentary technical support plus optional retainers for iterative optimization. Receive detailed analytics insights, conversion rate monitoring, and priority revisions to keep your landing page performing at peak efficiency.",
  },
  {
    id: "item-7",
    question: "Can you work with our existing brand guidelines?",
